            <h2 class="title">Concept: Conditionals</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">If you remember the assignment on Data Types, the Boolean data type can hold one of two values: true or false. We will use this data type often because conditionals are statements that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition is true or false. They are the building blocks of decision-making logic in your programs.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title">If Statements</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The most basic conditional statement that you can have is the if statement. If a condition is true, run a specific set of instructions. Here is an example:</p>

<code class="block-code">let danIsADog = false;

if (danIsADog === true) {
    console.log("WOOF");
}
</code>

            <p class="paragraph">As you can see above, if I was a dog, the console would log “WOOF.” Since I am clearly not a dog, the console does not log “WOOF.” What if I wanted to log to the console “I am a human” when the condition is evaluated? If we log to the console “Dan is a human” at the end of the script, it would always print “Dan is a human” despite the actual value of <code class="inline-code">danIsADog</code>. We can solve this by adding an else statement to the if block.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title">If/Else Statements</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We can think of If/Else statements as, “if this value is true, then do this. Otherwise, do that.” Let’s continue with this dog example!
            </p>

<code class="block-code">let danIsADog = false;

if (danIsADog === true) {
    console.log("WOOF");
} else {
    console.log("Dan is a human.");
}
</code>


            
            <p class="paragraph">There! Now we have confirmation that I am not a dog by logging it to the console in the else block.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title">If/Else If/Else</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Moving away from the question of my humanity, what if we wanted to have multiple conditions to check for? Here's a quick example:
            </p>

<code class="block-code">let healthPoints = 5;

if (healthPoints >= 10) {
    console.log("Hero is healthy.");
} else if (healthPoints < 10 && healthPoints >= 5) {
    console.log("Hero is slightly damaged.");
} else {
    console.log("Hero is close to death.");
}
</code>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                It is highly recommended to read through the <a class="text-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Conditionals">MDN documentation on Conditionals.</a> and more about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else" class="text-link">if/else</a> before continuing.
            </p>

            
            <h3 class="sub-title">Experiment Time</h3>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Open <code class="inline-code">index.js</code> and try the following:</p>
            
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">Copy the last code block into your script and change the hero's health points to see what logic gets executed.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Create a couple if statements that are meaningful.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Create a couple if/else statements that are meaningful.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Create a couple if/else if/else statements that are meaningful.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="paragraph">Once you are done experimenting, comment out your code.</p>
